## ML-Model-Flask-Deployment
This is a demo project to elaborate how Machine Learn Models are deployed on production using Flask API

### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) and Flask (for API) installed.

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts :
1. model.py - This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to predict employee salaries absed on trainign data in 'hiring.csv' file.
2. app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives employee details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3. request.py - This uses requests module to call APIs already defined in app.py and dispalys the returned value.
4. templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter employee detail and displays the predicted employee salary.

### Running the project
1)
go to project directory and run app file 
python app.py
then copy that link "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
paste in brouser

2)
we can run through requests also .. ..open request file to understand it.
